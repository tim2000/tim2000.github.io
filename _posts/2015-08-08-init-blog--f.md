It's been a while since I want to start my blog, everyday I learn some new technical stuff, and I always think "Wow that is really great, I'll need to share it", or sometimes get angry corecting a bug and think "That was really crappy stuff, poor me, maybe I can save another poor developer if I write about this".

So it's begin, I hope to write on it a lot, but I don't even know if I will like it since it's my first blogging experience. English language is a challenge for me too, I'm french, and I hope to work in an english speaking country in one to two years, I need the to practice english too, and I think writing it can help me.  

I have never really liked Web Develoment, this is why I've chose Jekyl. It's easy, fast, and free. I like using git too, I havn't used it a lot, and I think I need to practice it.

So let's talk about me a bit, I'm curently a 22 years student in computer engineering. I've made all my studies in "sandwich courses", where I have worked in two diferent company. First one was KEOLABS where I've learned programing by using javascript. The project KEOLABS gave me was a NFC NDEF LLCP analyzer, and that was fun ! Since this moment, I fell in love with C++.

I'm now working on a company named ACTOLL, where I am one of the three C++ embedded developpers. I learned strict coding, continuous integration, unit testing, and more. Now our project is to develop a NFC Payment system to sell tickets directly inside a bus. 

Now you know who I am, let's go, and we'll see what we can do with this.
